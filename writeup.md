## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/972/view) Points
### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  

You're reading it!

### Kinematic Analysis
#### 1. Run the forward_kinematics demo and evaluate the kr210.urdf.xacro file to perform kinematic analysis of Kuka KR210 robot and derive its DH parameters.

Calculations done on notebook according to the information learned during the course and the analysis of the kuka arm and its urdf file.

#### 2. Using the DH parameter table you derived earlier, create individual transformation matrices about each joint. In addition, also generate a generalized homogeneous transform between base_link and gripper_link using only end-effector(gripper) pose.

Links | alpha(i-1) | a(i-1) | d(i-1) | theta(i)
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
0->1 | 0 | 0 | 0.75 | 0
1->2 | - pi/2 | 0.35 | 0 | q2 - pi/2
2->3 | 0 | 1.25 | 0 | 0
3->4 |  -pi/2 | -0.054 | 1.5 | 0
4->5 | pi/2 | 0 | 0 | 0
5->6 | -pi/2 | 0 | 0 | 0
6->EE | 0 | 0 | 0.303 | 0

Having found these DH parameters, the individual transformation matrices would have the following structure:

 -| - | - | - 
--- | --- | --- | ---
cos(q)           | -sin(q)          | 0| a
sin(q)*cos(alpha)| cos(q)*cos(alpha)| -sin(alpha)| -sin(alpha)*d
sin(q)*sin(alpha)| cos(q)*sin(alpha)|  cos(alpha)|  cos(alpha)*d
0|0              | 0                |1

Then with this structure, I would substitute variables: q, alpha, d & a with the corresponding values for each matrix:

```
T0_1 = DH_T_Matrix(q1, alpha0, d1, a0).subs(s)
T1_2 = DH_T_Matrix(q2, alpha1, d2, a1).subs(s)
T2_3 = DH_T_Matrix(q3, alpha2, d3, a2).subs(s)
T3_4 = DH_T_Matrix(q4, alpha3, d4, a3).subs(s)
T4_5 = DH_T_Matrix(q5, alpha4, d5, a4).subs(s)
T5_6 = DH_T_Matrix(q6, alpha5, d6, a5).subs(s)
T6_G = DH_T_Matrix(q7, alpha6, d7, a6).subs(s)
```

being "s" the DH parameters dictionary

Then, in order to calculate the transform between base_link and gripper_link, I would calculate the product of all the previous matrices:

`T0_G = simplify(T0_1*T1_2*T2_3*T3_4*T4_5*T5_6*T6_G)`

#### 3. Decouple Inverse Kinematics problem into Inverse Position Kinematics and inverse Orientation Kinematics; doing so derive the equations to calculate all individual joint angles.

Theta 1 may be easily calculated as the angle between the plane win which the arm is moving and the x axis on the real world plane. Meaning that the equation for theta 1 would be something like the following:

`theta 1 = atan2(y, x)`

Regarding theta 2 and theta 3, the calculations would be carried out according to the following image:

![alt text][image2]

Where the y axis would correspond to the z axis in the "real world coordinates", being the resulting equations the following:

```
theta2 = pi/2 - angle_a - atan2(Wpos[2] - 0.75, sqrt(Wpos[0]*Wpos[0] + Wpos[1]*Wpos[1]) - 0.35)
theta3 = pi/2 - (angle_b + 0.036)
```

where Wpos is the position of the wrist center. Being 0,1 and 2, its coordinates for x,y,x respectively.

Regarding theta 4, 5 & 6, given they are all centerd on the wrist center in the same point, their values are the corresponding ones to the rotation of each plane, being the resulting equations the following:

```
theta4 = atan2(R3_6[2,2], -R3_6[0,2])
theta5 = atan2(sqrt(R3_6[0,2]*R3_6[0,2] + R3_6[2,2]*R3_6[2,2]),R3_6[1,2])
theta6 = atan2(-R3_6[1,1], R3_6[1,0])
```

Where R3_6 is the rotation matrix from joint 3 to joint 6.

### Project Implementation

#### 1. Fill in the `IK_server.py` file with properly commented python code for calculating Inverse Kinematics based on previously performed Kinematic Analysis. Your code must guide the robot to successfully complete 8/10 pick and place cycles. Briefly discuss the code you implemented and your results. 

In the code, you may first find the calculation for the forward kinematics according to the DH parameters specified earlier in this document. Afterwards, I've carried out the calculations for the Inverse kinematics from the given end effector (wrist center) point from the simulator. With this position, the program calculates the corresponding angles for the robotic arm to reach the exact indicated position.

In order to improve the program runtime, I have directly introduced the resulting matrices for each step, instead of making the program carry out all matrices operations, since this took too much time (up to half a minute). In any case, the operations being carried out may be found commented right before the matrix in the code. Regarding the calculations for theta 2 and 3, they were carried out as specified before.

At first I had some issues with the angle at which the Kuka was leaving the cylinders, since it had a 90ยบ deviation, meaning it always released the cylinders right next to the bin at a 90ยบ movement in theta 5 until I realised that I had left out of the loop the rotation matrix from joint 0 to 3 (R0_3) and therefore was only initialized once per run and affecting the calculation of thetas 4 through 6 giving that 90ยบ deviation.

After having solved this, the robot arm always releases the cylinders in the exact same spot at the middel of the bin. The only issue that could lead to some error is the angle of the grip at the moment of grasping the object, since it sometimes pushes it before grabbing it and then it doesn't pick it up. Also I had to increase the gripping time in order for the arm to grab the object in continuous mode instead of step by step.

After having said all this, the result was very satisfactory, although I have the feeling I might be able to improve processing speed in order for the calculations and movement to be carried out faster. The final results can be seen in the following images with 8 and 9 cylinders in the bin.
